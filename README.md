### Project

- Tetris is a popular game, which is a field of 12 by 20 cells, certain types of figures fall from top to bottom in a completely random order.
- They must be positioned in such a way that they fit the shape and do not create empty spaces.
- The figures can only be moved horizontally, and you can also rotate the figures in different directions around their axis.
- You can speed up the falling speed of the figure.
- If you fill one row with no spaces, it will clear and one more row of pieces will be available, but if you fill all the rows with figures, the game will be over.
- The more rows you clear, the more points you get.
- Keep track of your game progress and score as many points as possible.
- The more points you score, the faster the figures fall.
